Changes in SecureFX 6.7 (Beta 4) -- May 3, 2011
-----------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - If a transfer was cancelled while multiple files were being
    downloaded and then the session was closed and reconnected,
    attempting to resume the transfer caused SecureFX to crash.
  - SecureFX menu customizations were sometimes not saved. 
  - When the /F parameter was used on the command line to specify
    the location of the configuration folder and the menu or toolbar
    was customized, the changes were not saved.
  - FTP: SecureFX could crash when a folder was being uploaded due
    to the way Send requests were handled.


Changes in SecureFX 6.7 (Beta 3) -- April 12, 2011
--------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - If the menu items "Add Bookmark" or "Open Bookmark" were added to
    the toolbar through customization and then were clicked after
    connecting to a host, SecureFX crashed.
  - If a session that used a firewall was connected and disconnected
    and then the session was modified to use a different firewall and
    then reconnected, the old firewall was used.
  - If the display of the Connect bar was toggled from the View menu
    and then modified in the Global Options dialog, the change in the
    Global Options dialog was not honored. 
  - If files were dragged from Windows Explorer into an empty local
    folder in SecureFX, the view was updated, but not all the files
    that had been dragged over were displayed.
  - If a synchronize session's direction was set to "Mirror local" and
    then was changed to "Mirror remote", the direction was not
    displayed correctly in the Synchronize Session Properties dialog
    even though the correct direction was used for the synchronize
    operation.
  - After pressing the ALT key and then the ENTER key, SecureFX
    attempted to connect to a host named "<ALT+R>".


Changes in SecureFX 6.7 (Beta 2) -- March 24, 2011
--------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - Removed warning message about toolbar and menu bar needing to be
    updated.
  - Added keyboard accelerators for the bookmark functions.  CTRL+B
    adds a bookmark and CTRL+O opens a bookmark.

Bug fixes:

  - SecureFX could crash when connecting to a session in a third tab.
  - It was not possible to get the Connect bar back if it was removed
    from the toolbar.
  - The Connect bar did not work when it was placed on the menu bar.
  - Fixed a typo in log message: "Could not set file attibutes" is now
    "Could not set file attributes".


Changes in SecureFX 6.7 (Beta 1) -- March 8, 2011
-------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - Added the ability to set and open bookmarks for frequently used
    folders.
  - Added an optional connect bar, which allows a connection to be
    made by entering the host on the toolbar.
  - Added an option to the Connect dialog to sort sessions logically,
    which is helpful when session names contain numbers.
  - Added the ability to copy and paste files from Eclipse to SecureFX.
  - SFXCL: Added a flag "/TransferType" which specifies the transfer
    type for all the files in the operation.
  - SFXCL: Added the ability to specify that the log file should be
    overwritten.

Changes:

  - If the option "Verify status on retrieve" is set, a STAT will
    always be issued before getting a file.  This makes the progress
    information more accurate for multiple file transfers if a file
    size changed between the time the transfer was started and the
    file was transferred.
  - SecureFX and SFXCL logs now indicate whether a file was transferred
    as binary or ASCII.
  - A duplicate message that was logged for file transfers statistics
    in server-to-server transfers was removed.
  - Entering the license data now registers the application for all
    users instead of only for the current user.
  - FTP: Changed the default value of the global options "Send Size"
    and "Receive Size" to 65535 in order to improve FTP transfer speed.
  - FTP, FTP/SSL: SecureFX attempts to use the control address for data
    connections first, which speeds up connection time in most cases.
    This change is only seen in new sessions.
  - FTP/SSL: When attempting to connect, a message showing the remote
    host is now logged.
  - SFXCL: Output is now written to stdout instead of stderr.

Bug fixes:

  - SecureFX crashed if a session was reconnected after its protocol
    was changed from FTP to SFTP.
  - SecureFX could crash when a second instance was started.
  - If the maximum number of parallel transfers was set to 8, SecureFX
    became unresponsive when attempting to transfer a large number of
    files (e.g., 10,000).
  - SecureFX was unable to download files from an EldoS server.
  - If the option "Disable directory tree detection" was set, file
    attributes were not set during transfer operations.
  - Double-clicking a folder that the current user did not have access
    to left focus in that folder.
  - SFXCL: If the "noprompt" parameter was specified, the invalid
    public key error was not reported.

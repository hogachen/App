Changes in SecureCRT 6.7 (Beta 4) -- May 3, 2011
------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - SecureCRT could crash on exit due to the way threads were being
    cleaned up.
  - SecureCRT crashed if a session with the "Auto reconnect" and
    "Close on disconnect" options enabled was disconnected.
  - SecureCRT crashed after pressing OK on the "Session Options", 
    "Lock Session", or "Confirm Disconnect" dialog if the session 
    that launched it had been closed after the dialog was displayed.
  - SecureCRT crashed after pressing OK on a script dialog if the
    session that launched the script had been closed after the dialog
    was displayed.
  - When the /F parameter was used on the command line to specify
    the location of the configuration folder and the menu or toolbar
    was customized, the changes were not saved.
  - A pop-up error message was displayed if the script method
    GetOption() was called with an unknown option name.
  - Serial: After connecting to a Windows COM port and then pressing
    any key, the CPU was pegged.
  - SSH2/SSH1: When a session established a port forward that launched
    an application, if the session attempted to connect using both an
    IPv4 and IPv6 address, two instances of the application were
    launched.
  - Windows: On Windows XP, if the display theme was set to Blue,
    Black, Aqua, or Silver and more than one SecureCRT window was
    connected to a session and "Send chat to all tabs" was used to
    send text to one of the sessions, it caused the other window to
    freeze.
  - Mac: If SecureCRT was run on a Mac system with the keyboard and
    mouse being controlled from another system running Synergy in
    server mode, the arrow keys did not work.
  - Mac: In the "Connect" dialog, the search string from the "Find
    Session" dialog was not remembered for subsequent searches.


Changes in SecureCRT 6.7 (Beta 3) -- April 12, 2011
---------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - If the Connect bar was removed from the toolbar through
    customization and then SecureCRT was restarted, attempting to
    bring up the customization dialog caused SecureCRT to crash.
  - If a script that called Crt.Screen.Send() was repeatedly run,
    it could cause terminal corruption and possibly a crash.
  - Under certain circumstances, after editing the Default session
    and attempting to apply the changes to all sessions, SecureCRT
    hung.
  - Scripts that called Crt.Screen.Send() to send end of line
    characters had different behavior than they did prior to
    version 6.7.
  - After pressing the ALT key and then the ENTER key, SecureCRT
    attempted to connect to a host named "<ALT+R>".
  - When the SecureCRT window was resized by dragging the mouse,
    the rows and columns displayed in the status bar were not
    updated until the mouse button was released.
  - If the Connect bar was removed from the toolbar through
    customization and SecureCRT was restarted, the Global Options
    dialog incorrectly showed that the Connect bar was visible.
  - Mac and Linux: SecureCRT crashed when attempting to connect to
    a session with a misconfigured HTTP firewall.

    dragged to the top of the desktop, the full height option did
    not work.
  - Mac: When the accelerator COMMAND+` was used to cycle through
    the SecureCRT windows, a "`" character was inserted into the
    session.
  - Mac: If two sessions were connected in different windows and one
    of the sessions was maximized and the second session was dragged
    into the first window and then sent out to a new window, the
    second session was not the correct size.
  - Mac/Linux: If an invalid license was on the clipboard, the
    license wizard did not display the correct text.
  - Linux: On 32-bit Ubuntu 10.x, it was not possible to add SSH1
    keys to the agent.

Changes in SecureCRT 6.7 (Beta 1) -- March 8, 2011
--------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - Linux versions for Ubuntu 10.x (32-bit and 64-bit) and Red Hat
    Enterprise Linux 5.5 (32-bit and 64-bit).
  - Added an optional connect bar, which allows a connection to be
    made by entering the host on the toolbar.
  - Added support for recording Python scripts.
  - Added the ability to add more than ten buttons to a button bar.
  - Added the ability to copy buttons from one button bar and paste
    them on another button bar.
  - Added the ability to move buttons within a button bar.
  - Added the ability to map a key or button to browse for a script
    to run.
  - Added the ability to configure the double-click tab action to be
    "Clone Tab in New Window".
  - Added an option to the Connect dialog to sort sessions logically,
    which is helpful when session names contain numbers.
  - In the Session Options dialog, added ability to sort columns in
    the Connection / Port Forwarding category.
  - Added support for in-line composition of IME characters so that
    IME characters are inserted into the session window as they are
    typed.
  - Added the script function FileOpenDialog() that displays the file
    browser and returns the selected file.
  - Added the script function ScriptFullName() that returns the full
    path and filename of the currently running script.
  - Added an optional parameter to the scripting function Connect()
    that allows pop-up messages to be suppressed.
  - Added the ability to specify a listening IP address when setting
    up a local or remote port forward from the command line.
  - Added a global INI-file-only option "Script MRU Count" that
    allows the number of scripts displayed in the recently used
    script list to be specified.
  - When the global INI-file-only option "Single Instance" is set
    and SecureCRT is already running, shortcuts that use the /S flag
    now open the specified session in a new tab.
  - Windows: Environment variables can be specified when assigning a
    "Run Script" or "Launch Application" function to a button or key.
  - Mac: If a file or folder is dragged to a local shell session, the
    path to the file is pasted into the session.  When a file or
    folder is dragged to the remote session, there is now a "Paste
    Path" option on the menu that is displayed.
  - Mac: Added the ability to specify SecureCRT as the default
    Telnet handler so that HTML links to Telnet sessions connect to
    the specified session in SecureCRT.

    BIG5 (950), Korean (949), Shift JIS (932).

Changes:

  - Line and character send delay settings are now honored for
    buttons and keys mapped to send strings.
  - When pasting text into SecureCRT, LF is converted to CRLF.

    the Session Options dialog.  Previously, it had to be set manually
    in the session .INI file.
  - The button and keymap Menu function MENU_TAB_NEXT now has the same
    behavior as pressing and releasing CTRL+TAB.  The Menu function
    MENU_TAB_PREV now has the same behavior as pressing and releasing
    SHIFT+CTRL+TAB.
  - If a script is already running and an attempt is made to run another
    script, a message is displayed.
  - Windows: Entering the license data now registers the application
    for all users instead of only for the current user.
  - Mac: Scrolling performance has been improved.
  - Mac: The auto session list now displays icons for the items in the
    list.
  - Mac: The history, readme, and EULA files are installed in the
    /Library/Application Support/VanDyke/SecureCRT folder.

Bug fixes:

  - If SecureCRT closed while a dialog was being displayed, it
    crashed.
  - If an escape sequence that sent a large file (1 MB or larger) was
    running and SecureCRT was exited during the send, it crashed.
  - If a script set a session's columns to be larger than the
    maximum number of columns and then that session was used,
    SecureCRT crashed.
  - SecureCRT could crash if it was in the process of closing and a
    script attempted to access an object that no longer existed.
  - SecureCRT could crash when a second instance was started.
  - SecureCRT terminal locked up after exiting a remote command such
    as "vi" or "man" if the window was resized while the command was
    running.
  - Python scripts that contained a Unicode character in the script
    name could not be run.
  - In some cases, screen reading software such as JAWS was not able
    to track the cursor when the cursor style was set to "Block".  If
    the "Use trackable insertion carat" option is set, the "Vertical
    Bar" cursor style is now used.
  - If a key or button was mapped to launch an application that did
    not have an ".EXE" file extension and an argument was specified,
    the specified argument was not saved.
  - If a session used ANSI color and a color scheme and the scrollback
    buffer contained text, if ANSI color was disabled and re-enabled,
    some characters in the scrollback buffer were displayed using
    incorrect foreground and background colors.
  - Highlighted text sometimes flickered.
  - In the Connect dialog, if the right mouse button was clicked on
    title bar or toolbar, the context menu was not displayed at the
    mouse cursor.
  - Telnet: When an unrecognized IAC SB option was received, garbage
    was displayed in the session.
  - SSH1/SSH2: On Windows Vista and Windows 7, if "localhost" was
    specified for port forwarding, it resolved to an IPv6 address,
    which caused the port forward to fail.
  - SFTP: In the SFTP tab, when an "ls" command was issued and the
    files had long names, the spacing of the output was not correct.
  - SFTP: In the SFTP tab, tab completion did not work with character
    encodings such as utf-8, koi8-r, and OEM=cp866.
  - Windows: When a Perl script was specified on the SecureCRT command
    line, an error was thrown if the script called Crt->Quit().
  - Mac: SecureCRT crashed if a session was being renamed from the
    Connect dialog and then another action such as Edit or Delete was
    performed on that session.
  - Mac: Viewing a host key could cause SecureCRT to crash.
  - Mac: On keyboards where "+", "]", and "*" are on the same key,
    keyboard shortcuts using those keys did not work in applications
    such as vi and vim.
  - Mac: If a script was launched from a button or mapped key, the
    script could not be cancelled from the Script menu.
  - Mac: If SecureCRT was displayed on a second monitor that was larger
    than the first monitor and was later run with only the first
    monitor connected, it was not possible to resize the window to fit
    on the screen.
  - Mac: If the SecureCRT window was moved to a different location
    before connecting to a session and then it was exited, flashing
    occurred the next time SecureCRT started.
  - Mac: If "%U" was specified in the Title bar for a local shell
    session, the user name was not substituted.
